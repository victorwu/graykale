## What is Gray Kale? 

Gray Kale is an app that enables/disables the grayscale accessibility option on macOS Sierra. The goal of using grayscale is to help prevent information overload by decreasing sensory input, in this case, color.


## How much is GrayKale?

GrayKale is completely free. I only ask for you to share this if you have found it useful.



#### Quick Setup

1. Drag the "GrayKale.app" file to your apps folder
2. Drag it to your dashboard for easy access
3. Click on the app to use it
  - Feel free to rename the file if you like

#### Build from source (latest update from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251014144)

1. Open "Script Editor"
2. Navigate to Graykale folder
3. Select "graykale.applescript"
4. Click on the play button to Run the Script
5. If it works, click the hammer "Compile the Script"

#### Using GrayKale Automator

This one is a bit glitchy and requires more steps, but it could be added to the touchbar.
Need to add "Automator" from Applications/ and "GrayKaleAutomator" from this Git to "Security & Privacy" settings, under "Full Disk Access" and "Accessibility"

## Uninstallation

To uninstall, simply remove the file from your Applications folder and/or delete.
